# Program: Creating Tree Protection Zones with Diameter at Breast Height
# Author: Andy Chand
# Version: 1.0
# Date: Jan. 19, 2021
# Purpose: Takes in points and measured DBH's (Diameter at breast height) of trees to find 
# and then apply a tree protection zone (TPZ) by dissolving overlapping zones
# Dependencies: arcpy
